    "# Can hitters change their behavior in different game situations? #\n",
    "In recent years, there has a proliferation of defensive shifts in baseball. Teams identify a hitter's tendencies, and then change their positioning on the field to maximize their chances of getting the hitter out. We've seen this in the most extreme where the right side of the infield is overloaded - the 3rd baseman plays at the shortstop position, the shortstop is positioned behind 2nd, and the 2nd baseman is in short right field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question for a fan seeing a defensive shift is, why don't hitters just hit it to the 3rd base side and take the single? Instead, hitters often hit the ball right into the shift. As long as the shift is working, teams will continue to use it to increase their chances of getting hitters out.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another question that arises about hitters - can hitters change their natural tendencies to match the game situation? For example, can hitters who don't hit a lot of fly balls hit a fly ball with a runner on 3rd and no outs to get the sacrifice? Can natural fly ball hitters hit a ground ball to the right side with a runner on 2nd and no outs? There are scenarios when a hitters behavior could have a benefit for the team's ability to score a run.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is current trend of applying a defensive shift, primarily for left-handed pull hitters. The result is a defensive alignment where the 3rd baseman plays at the shortstop position, the shortstop is behind 2nd base in short center field, and the 2nd baseman is shifted over toward 1st base in short right field. The obvious question is, why don't hitters just adjust their tendencies and hit the ball somewhere else?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Situational performance scenarios ##\n",
    "For any game situation, are some players better than other at adjusting their behavior to match the situation? Alternatively, we could ask if there is a change in behavior, whether intentional or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rockies fans watched for years as Troy Tulowitski came to bat with runners on base and hit a long fly ball out. It's hard not to wonder if he's trying to hit a home run. Whether intentional or unintentional, can we determine if his behavior changes with runners on base, especially in late innings with the game on the line? Is he trying to be the hero?\n",
    "\n",
    "* With a runner on third and less than two outs, it's nice to see that run score. Yet, batters aren't always successful in hitting a fly ball in that situation. Can we determine if some batters are more likely to hit a fly ball in that situation than they would normally?\n",
    "\n",
    "* With a runner on 2nd and no outs, getting the runner to 3rd means that the runner scores on a sacrifice fly. In a close game, moving this runner could be key to scoring a winning or tying run. Can we determine if some batters can hit a right-side ground ball in this situation even if they don't normally hit ground balls to the right side?\n",

    "To generate a bootstrap resample in this example, we generate a random number, 1-10, that represents a position in our array of observations.

We have 1,000 iterations of $n$ draws, and in each of the $n$ draws, there is a number of times that B is observed.\n",
